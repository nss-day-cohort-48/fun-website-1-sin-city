          <p>
            Pachinko (パチンコ) is a type of mechanical game originating in
            Japan and is used as both a form of recreational arcade game and
            much more frequently as a gambling device, filling a Japanese
            gambling niche comparable to that of the slot machine in Western
            gambling.

            machine (British English), puggy (Scottish English),[1] the slots
            (Canadian English and American English), poker machine/pokies
            (Australian English and New Zealand English), fruities (British
            English) or slots (American English), is a gambling machine that
            creates a game of chance for its customers. Slot machines are also
            known pejoratively as one-armed bandits because of the large
            mechanical levers affixed to the sides of early mechanical machines
            and the games' ability to empty players' pockets and wallets as
            thieves would.
